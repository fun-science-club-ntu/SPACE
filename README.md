# SPACE: Shiny Pan-cancer Accessible Chromatin Explorer
Here, we develop Shiny Pan-cancer Accessible Chromatin Explorer (SPACE) as an all-in-one web server of 562,709 regulatory elements in 404 patients across 23 cancer types. SPACE is a web application supporting ATAC-seq analysis with matched clinical phenotype and transcriptome data.

## SPACE supports
 - Explore active DNA regulatory elements of genes;
 - Search the potential binding TFs of peaks;
 - View peak expression according to the clinical phenotypes such as cancer subtypes or patient prognosis;
 - Compute the associated signalling pathways of regulatory elements;
 - Explore the role of peaks in the tumor immune microenvironment;
 - Investigate correlations between TFs/mRNAs/lncRNAs/miRNAs and peaks across cancers.

## Methods
Available on SPACE website.

## Data sourse
The Cancer Genome Atlas (Corces et al., Science 2018).
